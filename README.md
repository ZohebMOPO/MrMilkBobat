## How to Contribute
1. Go to [Discord Developer](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a New Application
3. In that application, go to the bot tab in the sidebar and create a new bot
4. Copy the token from that bot
5. Go to the OAuth2 tab in the sidebar and click all the relevant permissions -- `bot` then `Administrator` (if you're working on your own test server, sometimes it's easier to just do `Administrator` privileges).
6. Open the URL generated and invite the bot to your preferred server.
1. Fork the [Replit](https://replit.com/@maralihart/MilkFriendsBot#README.md) repo.
8. Take the token you copied earlier and click the lock icon in the Replit sidebar. This should open the Secrets tab.
9. Make the key `TOKEN` and paste your token in value and then press `Add new secret`.
10. Run the bot, it should now be online!
10. Take whatever code you changed and submit a pull request!
